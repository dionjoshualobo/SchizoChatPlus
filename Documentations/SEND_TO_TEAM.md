## 🚀 SchizoChatPlus - Team Assignment

Hi Team! 👋

We're starting development on **SchizoChatPlus** - an educational Tor-simulated network with AI-based intrusion detection.

### 📚 Documentation Created

I've prepared comprehensive documentation for our project:

1. **START_HERE.md** - Quick start guide (read this first!)
2. **PROJECT_SUMMARY.md** - Project overview and timeline
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture diagrams
4. **TEAM_WORK_DISTRIBUTION.md** - Complete detailed guide (60+ pages) with all assignments
5. **QUICK_REFERENCE.md** - Quick lookup reference
6. **WORK_DISTRIBUTION_VISUAL.md** - Visual summary and checklists
